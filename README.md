This project involves creating a Selenium Web Scraper tailored for collecting cryptocurrency data from <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>. By 
employing web automation, the scraper systematically extracts 
data from selected cryptocurrency sources. The obtained information encompasses a wide array of data points. This data is then efficiently stored within a PostgreSQL 
database for further access and analysis.
